Welcome to PyRCWA's documentation!
==================================
Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) is a semi-analytical method in computational electromagnetics that is most \
typically applied to solve scattering from periodic dielectric structures. It is a Fourier-space method so devices \
and fields are represented as a sum of spatial harmonics.

Vision
==================

The vision of PyRCWA is to be a high-performance numerical simulation tool that can be used to solve electromagnetic \
field propagation in multi-layered periodic structures with complex material systems.

To be updated in the future
====================================

1. Support the GPU acceleration
